## 1) Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) ↔ AWS IAM/Identity Center/Cognito ↔ GCP IAM/Cloud Identity/Identity Platform

### Comparison Table

| Aspect                    | **Entra ID (Azure AD)**                                      | **AWS IAM / Identity Center / Cognito**                      | **GCP Cloud IAM / Cloud Identity / Identity Platform**       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Overview**              | Cloud directory & identity platform for workforce and external users; SSO, MFA, Conditional Access, app registrations, service principals, managed identities. | IAM manages permissions to AWS resources; Identity Center provides SSO to accounts/apps; Cognito offers end‑user auth (B2C/B2B). | Cloud IAM controls access to GCP resources; Cloud Identity provides org directory/SSO; Identity Platform provides end‑user auth (B2C/B2B). |
| **Core Features**         | SSO (SAML/OIDC), Conditional Access, MFA/Passwordless, PIM (just‑in‑time admin), B2B/B2C, SCIM, Workload identities/service principals, Managed Identity. | IAM policies/roles, STS, role assumption, Identity Center SSO, SAML/OIDC app integrations, Cognito User Pools & federation, device posture via integrations. | IAM roles/policies, Workforce identity federation, Cloud Identity SSO, Context‑aware access, Identity‑Aware Proxy (IAP), Identity Platform (OIDC/SAML), Workforce/Workload Identity Federation. |
| **Security & Compliance** | Broad certifications (e.g., ISO/SOC/PCI/HIPAA/FedRAMP) and conditional access/risk‑based policies; identity protection; audit logs (Sign‑in/Directory). | Broad certifications across AWS; IAM with CloudTrail auditing; MFA; Organizations SCPs; Cognito with secure token services. | Broad certifications across GCP; IAM audit logs; BeyondCorp/IAP model; Cloud Identity enterprise features. |
| **Pricing Model**         | Free, **P1**, **P2** tiers; B2C MAU‑based.                   | IAM no direct charge; Identity Center typically no extra charge; **Cognito** billed per MAU and features. | Cloud IAM no direct charge; **Cloud Identity** Free/Premium (per user); **Identity Platform** MAU‑based. |
| **DevSecOps Integration** | OIDC federation for CI/CD (GitHub Actions) → federated credentials; Managed Identity for Azure workloads; Conditional Access for admin access; SCIM for user provisioning. | OIDC federation from CI/CD to IAM roles (GitHub OIDC); cross‑account roles; Cognito hosted UI/SDKs; SCP guardrails. | Workload/Workforce Identity Federation for CI/CD; IAP in front of Cloud Run/GCE; Identity Platform SDKs; org‑level policies for admin access. |

### Narrative Analysis

- **Design pattern:** Workforce identity (admins, engineers) + end‑user identity (apps). Azure often uses **Entra ID** for both; AWS/GCP split workforce IAM from customer identity products.
- **Conditional access/risk‑based controls** are strong in Entra ID; GCP emphasizes **context‑aware access** and **IAP**; AWS leans on IAM, **Organizations/SCPs**, and **Identity Center**.
- **For pipelines**, prefer **OIDC federation** over long‑lived keys across all clouds.

**Strengths / Weaknesses**

- **Azure:** 
  - **Strengths**: Rich conditional access, PIM; 
  - **Weaknesses**: Licensing complexity (P1 vs P2 vs B2C).
- **AWS:** 
  - **Strengths**: Fine‑grained IAM & role assumption; 
  - **Weaknesses**: End‑user identity needs **Cognito** (separate service).
- **GCP:** 
  - **Strengths**: BeyondCorp/IAP model; 
  - **Weaknesses**: Split between Cloud Identity vs Identity Platform can confuse new teams.

| **DevSecOps Integration** | CI/CD emits deployment events to logs; KQL powers anomaly detection; dashboards/workbooks for SLOs; native hooks to **Sentinel**. | CloudWatch alarms drive **SNS/Lambda** runbooks; Logs Insights in incident playbooks. | Logging sinks to **Pub/Sub/BigQuery**; alerting hooks to **Cloud Functions/Run**; SRE SLO tooling. |

### Narrative Analysis

- **KQL** is a major Azure differentiator for rapid threat/ops queries. AWS/GCP offer capable but different syntaxes (Logs Insights / Monitoring QL).
- **OpenTelemetry** is supported across clouds; use it to standardize tracing and log attributes.
- For **cost control**, route verbose app logs to cold storage (e.g., Storage/S3/GCS) and keep high‑value signals in the hot workspace.

**Strengths / Weaknesses**

- **Azure:** 
  - **Strengths**: KQL power; rich PaaS diagnostic connectors. 
  - **Weaknesses**: Ingestion costs can spike without sampling.
- **AWS:** 
  - **Strengths**: Tight with eventing (SNS/EventBridge). 
  - **Weaknesses**: Multiple consoles (Logs, Metrics, X‑Ray) can feel fragmented.
- **GCP:** 
  - **Strengths**: Strong BigQuery integration for analytics. 
  - **Weaknesses**: Query language differences vs KQL require relearning.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Overview**              | Policy as code to **deny/audit/remediate** non‑compliant resources; assignments at mgmt group/subscription/resource group. | SCPs enforce guardrails at org/account level; **AWS Config** evaluates resource compliance; Conformance Packs group rules. | Org Policy enforces constraints (e.g., locations, external IPs, CMEK); **Policy Controller** (OPA/Gatekeeper) validates K8s configs. |
| **Core Features**         | Effects: `Deny`, `Audit`, `Append`, `DeployIfNotExists`, `Modify`; initiatives; parameters; remediation tasks. | SCP conditions (e.g., regions), Config managed/custom rules, auto‑remediation via SSM/Lambda; conformance packs. | Predefined constraints, custom org policies; policy inheritance; fleet‑wide K8s policy via Gatekeeper; violations surfaced in Cloud Console. |
| **Security & Compliance** | Enforce data residency, tagging, network posture; compliance dashboard via Policy Insights. | Guardrails for PCI/HIPAA baselines using Conformance Packs; audit via CloudTrail/Config. | Org Policies for location/egress/CMEK; SCC integrates violations; audit logs. |
| **Pricing Model**         | Policy evaluation generally **no direct charge**; remediation may use runtime services (Functions/Automation). | **Config** billed per rule/resource evaluations; SCPs no direct charge. | Org Policy **no direct charge**; Policy Controller billed with GKE; remediation actions may incur costs. |
| **DevSecOps Integration** | Treat policies as code (Bicep/ARM/Terraform); **policy gates** in CI/CD; exemptions workflow; export to Git. | Policy‑as‑code via CloudFormation/Terraform; pre‑deploy hooks; pipeline checks with **cfn‑guard/Conftest**. | Policy‑as‑code via Terraform/CLI; **OPA/Conftest** in CI; validate before `gcloud`/Terraform applies. |

### Narrative Analysis

- Use **preventive controls** (deny at creation) before detective controls to minimize blast radius.
- Centralize policies as code with change control and **exceptions (exemptions)** workflow.

**Strengths / Weaknesses**

- **Azure:** 
  - **Strengths**: Rich effects (`DeployIfNotExists`); initiatives scale well. 
  - **Weaknesses**: Authoring JSON with aliases has a learning curve.
- **AWS:** 
  - **Strengths**: SCPs provide hard guardrails; Config rules cover deep resource posture. 
  - **Weaknesses**: Config pricing can add up at scale.
- **GCP:** 
  - **Strengths**: Simple constraints for common needs; strong K8s policy via Gatekeeper. 
  - **Weaknesses**: Fewer turnkey constraints vs Azure’s effects.

| **DevSecOps Integration** | Rules‑as‑code in Git; CI to validate/deploy analytics & playbooks; automation via Logic Apps; Jupyter notebooks for threat hunting. | IaC for lake infra; detections as code in OpenSearch/partner SIEM; response via Lambda/Step Functions. | Detections/playbooks as code; response via Cloud Functions/Run; exporter sinks for pipelines. |

### Narrative Analysis

- **Sentinel** is an opinionated, full **SIEM/SOAR**. AWS provides primitives (**Security Lake**, **OpenSearch**) and relies on partner SIEMs for parity. GCP’s **Chronicle** is the closest like‑for‑like managed SIEM.
- Standardize on a schema (e.g., **OCSF**/**ASIM**) to ease multi‑cloud correlation.

**Strengths / Weaknesses**

- **Azure:** 
  - **Strengths**: First‑party connectors and KQL; built‑in SOAR. 
  - **Weaknesses**: Ingestion costs require governance (commitment tiers/archiving).
- **AWS:** 
  - **Strengths**: Flexible lake architecture; choose best‑fit SIEM. 
  - **Weaknesses**: DIY assembly increases complexity/time‑to‑value.
- **GCP:** 
  - **Strengths**: Managed SIEM/SOAR at scale. 
  - **Weaknesses**: Licensing/tier clarity needed early.

------

## 6) Cross‑Cutting DevSecOps Practices (All Clouds)

- **Identity for CI/CD**: Prefer **OIDC federation** from GitHub/GitLab to temporary cloud credentials (avoid long‑lived keys).
- **IaC & Policy‑as‑Code**: Use Terraform/Bicep/ARM (Azure), CloudFormation/CDK (AWS), Terraform/CLI (GCP). Integrate **policy checks** (Azure Policy, SCPs + Config, Org Policies) in PR gates with **Conftest/OPA/cfn‑guard**.
- **Secrets Management**: Azure Key Vault ↔ AWS Secrets Manager/KMS ↔ GCP Secret Manager/KMS; rotate and scope to workloads.
- **Observability**: Adopt **OpenTelemetry** for traces/logs/metrics; centralize logs selectively to control cost.
- **Threat Modeling & Runbooks**: Define playbooks for common incidents (credential stuffing, brute force, anomalous admin activity) and codify remediation (Logic Apps / Lambda / Cloud Functions).
- **Data Residency**: Enforce allowed regions via Azure Policy / SCPs / Org Policy; audit exceptions.

## 7) Pricing Considerations (High‑Level)

- **Identity**: Entra ID (Free/P1/P2; B2C MAU), Cognito (MAU), Cloud Identity (per‑user), Identity Platform (MAU).
- **Observability**: All three clouds largely bill **per‑GB ingestion/retention**; traces and advanced analytics add compute costs.
- **Policy**: Azure Policy/Org Policy/SCPs usually no direct charge; **AWS Config** charges per rule/resource evaluation.
- **CSPM/CWPP**: Defender plans per resource; AWS split pricing (GuardDuty, Inspector, Security Hub, Detective); GCP SCC Premium subscription + per‑feature costs.
- **SIEM/SOAR**: Sentinel per‑GB or commitment; AWS components (S3/Athena/OpenSearch) + partner SIEM; Chronicle subscription/ingest.

------

## 8) Putting It Together – Example Control Stack

- **Preventive**: Azure Policy (deny non‑Canada regions, require tags, block public IPs) ↔ AWS SCP/Config ↔ GCP Org Policy.
- **Detective**: KQL in Log Analytics for brute‑force and protected‑route abuse ↔ CloudWatch Logs Insights ↔ Cloud Logging queries.
- **Responsive**: Azure Monitor Alerts + Action Groups ↔ CloudWatch Alarms + SNS/Lambda ↔ Cloud Monitoring Alerts + Pub/Sub/Functions.
- **SIEM**: Microsoft Sentinel ↔ Security Lake + OpenSearch/partner SIEM ↔ Chronicle.

These mirror my prior course labs/assignments (Auth0 login, brute‑force detection, protected‑route abuse detection, Azure Policy governance).
